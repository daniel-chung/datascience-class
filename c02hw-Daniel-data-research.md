#Daniel's dataset research-Abalone data

I have chosen the abalone data to use for my dataset research project. The source of my dataset comes from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone?pagewanted=all).
The dataset and documentation can be found in the following links:
* [Data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data)
* [Documentation](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.names)


##### 1. What are the structure and contents of your dataset? (Number of records, columns, missing values, etc.)

The Abalone data contains various measurements collected on a sample of 4,177 abalone. From the documentation, we see that there are nine variables. The names of the variables along with other relevant information are summarized below:

|Variable name|Data type|Units|Description|
|:------------|:--------|:----|:----------|
|Sex|nominal|n/a|M, F, and I (infant)|
|Length|continuous|mm|Longest shell measurement|
|Diameter|continuous|mm|Widest shell measurement|
|Height|continuous|mm|Thickness with meat in shell|
|Whole weight|continuous|g|Weight of whole abalone|
|Shucked weight|continuous|g|Weight of meat|
|Viscera weight|continuous|g|Weight of gut (after bleeding)|
|Shell weight|continuous|g|Weight of shell after being dried|
|Rings|integer|n/a|Rings + 1.5 gives the age in years|


##### 2. What is the history of your dataset (How was it created?)


##### 3. Has your dataset been written about? What have others used it for?


##### 4. How do you acquire and load the dataset into R? (Include code.)


##### 5. What are some simple statistics describing the dataset?
