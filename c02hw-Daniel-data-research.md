#Daniel's dataset research-Abalone data

I have chosen the abalone data to use for my dataset research project. The source of my dataset comes from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone?pagewanted=all).
The dataset and documentation can be found in the following links:
  * [Data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data)
  * [Documentation](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.names)

* What are the structure and contents of your dataset? (Number of records, columns, missing values, etc.)

The Abalone data contains various measurements collected on a sample of 4,177 abalone.

* What is the history of your dataset (How was it created?)


* Has your dataset been written about? What have others used it for?


* How do you acquire and load the dataset into R? (Include code.)


* What are some simple statistics describing the dataset?
